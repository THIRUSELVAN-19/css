    <div><p id="amd1" >"Will you have something in books to-day?" <br>
        So the young woman prattled away,<br>
        Using her salesman lingo free,<br>
        Just as if books were pounds of tea.<br></p>
        
        <p>That is the way the business is run,<br>
        Books by the thousand, books by the ton,<br>
        Books by the measure of mason or cook.<br>
        And the bigger the pile, the bigger the book.<br></p>
        
        <p> "Something in books?" Yes, Miss Flippancy, yes:<br>
        Something your big store does not possess.<br>
        Give me a hook that was horn of the heart,<br>
        Free from the stains of the bank and the mart.<br></p>
        
        <p>Give me a book that is known of the trees,<br>
        Comrade of clouds and at home with the bees;<br>
        Give me a book I shall have as a friend,<br>
        Daytime and nighttime, till living shall end.<br></p></div>
        
        <p id="amd5" >"Ye-e-s," says Miss Flippancy, doubtfully bold,<br>
        "Here's the best seller that ever we've sold.<br>
        Every one's reading it; going like fun,<br>
        We'll sell a thousand before the day's done."<br></p>
        
        <p id="amd6" >"Something in books," and the business is fine;<br>
        Let the stores carry "a popular line."<br>
        But come, dear old books, well tested and true,<br>
        Here's for an hour in a corner with you.<br></p>
        
        <p id="amd7" >You were never "best sellers," when put to the test,<br>
        But you are best readers, which surely is best;<br>
        And, though all the clerks should unite to deride,<br>
        The "something in books" is the something inside!</p>
